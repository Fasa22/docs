This article indicates whether each breaking change is *binary compatible* or *source compatible*:

- **Binary compatible** - Existing binaries won't encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, or exhibit different run-time behavior.
- **Source compatible** - Source code will compile successfully without changes when targeting the new runtime or using the new SDK or component.
